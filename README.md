# PCB(s) for the XFM2/XVA1 Project

This site contains some stuff I have built for the excellent FPGA XFM2/XVA FPGA DIY synths by futur3soundz/RenÃ© Ceballos. You can find them here: https://www.futur3soundz.com.

I tinker with electronics, release stuff when I feel like it and I make it public when it's maybe not perfect. I'm not an electronics expert, so I may not always know what I'm doing. I learn the necessary electronics as I use it. Use at your own risk.

Feedback is always very welcome ðŸ˜„ Feel free to ask question in the [discussions](https://github.com/bzeiss/synth-pcbs/discussions).
